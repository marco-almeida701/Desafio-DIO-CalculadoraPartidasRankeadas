# Ranked Matches Calculator

## Challenge Description
This project consists of a ranked matches calculator, where you will use fundamental programming concepts such as variables, operators, loops, decision structures, and functions.

## Objective
Create a function that receives as parameters the number of wins and losses of a player. Then, the function should calculate the balance of ranked matches using the formula (wins - losses) and determine the player's level based on the following conditions:

- If wins are less than 10 = Iron
- If wins are between 11 and 20 = Bronze
- If wins are between 21 and 50 = Silver
- If wins are between 51 and 80 = Gold
- If wins are between 81 and 90 = Diamond
- If wins are between 91 and 100 = Legendary
- If wins are greater than or equal to 101 = Immortal

## Output

In the end, the function should display the message:

**"The Hero has a balance of {balanceWins} and is at the {level} level"**

## Conclusion
This challenge provided a significant opportunity to apply and improve essential programming skills, including the use of variables, operators, loops, decision structures, and functions. By creating a ranked matches calculator, you explored practical programming logic concepts and developed a useful function to determine a player's level based on their wins and losses.
